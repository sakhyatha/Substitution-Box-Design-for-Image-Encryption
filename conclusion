Using simple and efficient techniques proposed by the authors S-boxes are designed by varying the parameters. To check its cryptographic strength using standard criteria, a sample S-box was assessed and analyzed. Based on the created S-box, an image encryption method is introduced. The process of image encryption requires permuting and substituting pixels using the designed S-box. For the study, different component measurements are used, such as measure of randomness, pixel correlation, intensity differences, energy, and homogeneity. Using the generated S-Box based pixel shuffling and replacement, the proposed image encryption algorithm explains its capabilities and scope for protecting sensitive data.
